This project was made as fulfillment for the course Technical Answers to Real-World Problems(TARP). 

This consists of an Arduino code that takes the value of the flex sensors, converts it to the bend angle which is then used to compute the sign for each alphabet based on the American Sign Language.

There is also an excel file that consists of the data collected by computing the bend angle of each finger to analyse and get the exact value to estimate the band angle for each alphabet.
